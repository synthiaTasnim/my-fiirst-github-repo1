    <div><h3>Job specialization</h3>
    <p>it is the degree to which task of an organisation is divided into smaller 
        component parts. <br><strong>advantages:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The more narrowly defined a job is the easier it is to
                develop specialised equipment to assist with ther job.  </li>
                <li>when the job is devided into smaller parts the worker becomes expart at it
                     </li>
                <li>when any employee resigns from an specialized job the employer can easily 
                    train some one new at a lower cost   </li>
                <li>transfer time between task decreases .From a research of 'Maytag' it has been seen that 
                    moving work in process takes less time comparing to moving person from job to job
                </li>
        
        </ul> 
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong>

    <div><h3>Delegation Process</h3>
        <p>delegation process is the process by which <strong>managers assign work to
             subordinates.</strong>It is the <strong>establish ment of pattern of authority 
                from supervisor to one or more subordinates. 
             </strong><br><strong>Steps in Delegation Process:</strong>




        </p></div>
        <div><h3>Centralisation and Decentralisation</h3>
            <p>Centralisation and decentralisation both are <strong>the pattern of authority </strong>
                across wide range/variety of department and position. 
                <br><strong>Decentralisation </strong>is the process of delegating 
                authority throughout the organisation to the middle managers and low level 
                managers. <br> <strong>Centralisation </strong> is the process of retaining authority 
                   and power to the higher level of management. <br><strong>Under what circumstances you 
                    would work in both centralised and decentralised organisation </strong> The circumstances
                     that help one to understand whether to work in a centralised or a deceentralised environment
                      includes : <ul>
                        <li> External environment</li>
                        <li>History of the organisation</li>
                          <li>Nature of decision</li>
                          <li>Ability of low level managers</li> 
                         </ul>
                    <strong>External environment:</strong> The greater the uncertainty and complexity 
                    of the environment the higher the tendency to to prefer decentralisation because 
                    complex and sensitive work environment requires specialists and expert people
                     to remain involved in the process of decision making.so for such case decentralised
                      destribution of authority is preferable. <br>          
                     <strong>History of organisation:</strong>organisation have the tendency o do what they have 
                     done in the past.So,there is relationship between what the organisation have done 
                     in its early history and what it will do in terms of Centralisation or 
                     decentralisation. <br> 
                      <strong>Qualification of lower level managers:</strong>If the lower level managers are 
                      well enough qualified to take dicision on behalf of their supervisors then the 
                      top level managers would take advantage of the suboerdinates' talent and go for
                       decentralisation. <br>
                       <strong>Nature of decision:</strong> The costlier and riskier the decision is 
                       the more pressure an individual feels to work in a centralised environment.
